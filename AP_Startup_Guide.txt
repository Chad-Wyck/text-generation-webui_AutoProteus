* If windows gives you security warnings running the .bats, you can ignore this warning if you click for more information, alternatively you can open them with any text editor and then copy and paste the commands into a cmd.exe that is in the root working directory, (type cmd.exe into the address bar in your folder explorer, "...text-generation-webui_AutoProteus/cmd.exe" and press enter, then you can run the copy pasted commands.

** You may need to Start_Windows.bat once and download the NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B model and once it's complete, repeat step 3.
